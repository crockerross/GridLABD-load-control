To run the feeder simulations with closed-loop control of the air conditioner population, you will need to compile the modified gridlabd source code (see source code folder). You will also need to link MATLAB and gridlabd. 

Folders beginning with "R1"-"R5" contain the simulation files for our project's "Main Study".
